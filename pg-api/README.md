On line 12 of server.js you need to cahnge data base from 'tommygallagher' to the database name of your choosing.

I set up a postgres table in that db called 'sheet'. The columns are as follows:

id (bigint)
name (varchar)
description (varchar)
price (varchar)


if you that set up it should be good to go.
